# 🌸 Superhero Floral Exhibit

A data-driven floral visualization inspired by:

- [Shirley Wu's Film Flowers](https://sxywu.com/filmflowers/)
- [Annie Liao's Baby Names Visualized as Flowers](https://dev.to/liaowow/when-art-meets-data-flowers-as-visual-metaphor-1ekl)

This project was developed as part of a CSE571 Data Visualization class assignment to creatively explore **data visualization** using **D3.js**.

## 🦸‍♀️ Project Overview

The **Superhero Floral Exhibit** transforms superhero characteristics into a garden of interactive floral designs. Each flower is a unique superhero, and the visual attributes of the flower encode multiple data features:

### 🌺 Floral Encoding

| Attribute            | Visualization                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Petal Shape & Color** | Encodes **gender** with distinct colors and shapes |
| **Number of Petals** | Represents **strength** — more petals mean higher strength |
| **Petal Size**       | Encodes **intelligence** — larger petals imply higher intelligence |
| **Hover Interaction**| Shows tooltip with **Name, Alignment, Strength, Gender, Intelligence** |
| **Click Interaction**| Opens a **link to the superhero's image** in a new tab |
